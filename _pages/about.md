My academic journey reached its culmination with the successful completion of a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics, an accomplishment I achieved under the esteemed guidance of <a href='http://math.ac.vn/en/component/staff/?task=getProfile&staffID=76'>Prof. Nguyen Dong Yen</a> and <a href='https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/MRAuthorID/263979'>Dr. Trinh Cong Dieu</a> at the Institute of Mathematics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology.

Following this milestone, I embarked on a four-year Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the Center for Mathematical Modeling (CMM) at the University of Chile, where I had the privilege of being mentored by <a href='https://www.arisdaniilidis.at/'>Prof. Aris Daniilidis</a> .

Presently, I hold the position of Senior Lecturer at Ho Chi Minh City University of Education. Additionally, I am an active member of the Group of Analysis and Applied Mathematics (GAAM). I am honored to to serve as an Associate Editor at the esteemed journal, <a href='https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/gopt20/about-this-journal#editorial-board'>Optimization</a> (A Journal of Mathematical Programming and Operations Research)
